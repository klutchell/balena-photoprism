## Manual Deployment

Alternatively, deployment can be carried out by manually creating a [balenaCloud account](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com) and application, flashing a device, downloading the project and pushing it via either Git or the [balena CLI](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli).

### Application Environment Variables

Application envionment variables apply to all services within the application, and can be applied fleet-wide to apply to multiple devices.

| Name              | Example           | Purpose                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TZ`              | `America/Toronto` | inform services of the [timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) in your location |
| `BALENA_HOSTNAME` | `photoprism`      | Set a custom hostname on application start so it can be reached via MDNS like `http://photoprism.local`          |

PhotoPrism environment variables are described here: <https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/config-options/>

## Usage

Once your device joins the fleet you'll need to allow some time for it to download the application and create the app database.

When it's done you should be able to access the access the app at <http://photoprism.local>.
